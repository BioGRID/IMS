			We attempted to connect and download a publication from Pubmed, but encountered problems preventing us from completing the operation. If this problem persists, or appears
			to be happening with multiple pubmed ids, it's likely a connectivity issue and the API may be inaccessible. If it's happening with just a single publication, it may
			be that there is something more sinister happening. Please contact the site administrator, in this case, and pass along the pubmed ID you're attempting to load.
